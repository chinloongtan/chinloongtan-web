{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\nToday I learned that I can send email with Zoho mail SMTP in my node.js application. Previously I am using SendGrid and decided to browse for alternative, and figured that Zoho mail SMTP is as simple as sending email with SendGrid.\n\n<br />\n\n#### Let's send that email!\n\n1. Add `nodemailer` to your node application\n\n```\nyarn add nodemailer\n```\n\n2. Import and start sending email\n\n```\nconst nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\n\nconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({\n  host: \"smtp.zoho.com\",\n  secure: true,\n  port: 465,\n  auth: {\n    user: \"your@zoho.mail\",\n    pass: process.env.ZOHO_APP_PASSWORD,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n```\nconst msg = {\n  to: email,\n  from: 'sender@email.address', // Change to your verified sender\n  subject: 'Your receipt',\n  text: 'Thank you for purchasing with us.',\n  html: emailTemplate, // html string or ejs template\n}\n\ntransporter.sendMail(msg, function(error, info) {\n  // handler\n});\n```\n\nFor the password, it is recommended to use Zoho app password. It works with two-factor authentication enabled for your Zoho account, and is easier to manage in case it is compromised.\n\nThat's it!\n\nHope that helps.\n\nCheers.\n","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/send-email-with-nodemailer-and-zoho-mail","date":"2022-02-13T17:45:00.000Z","title":"Send email with nodemailer and Zoho mail SMTP","excerpt":"An alternative to SendGrid","tags":["node.js"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2022/02/13-nodejs-mailer/index.md","timeToRead":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
