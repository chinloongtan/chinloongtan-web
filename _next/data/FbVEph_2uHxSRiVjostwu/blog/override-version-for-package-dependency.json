{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\nToday I learned how to resolve dependency version with `yarn`.\n\nImagine you have `react-native-permissions` in your `package.json`.\n\nAt the same time, you also have let's say `react-native-qrcode-scanner` with dependencies on `react-native-permissions`.\n\nNow, an issue arose when both the `react-native-permissions` require different versions, with one of them introduces breaking changes.\n\n\nThis is the kind of scenario where we can use [selective dependency resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).\n\nUsage example, in `package.json`:\n\n```\n  \"resolutions\": {\n    \"react-native-permissions\": \"^3.8.4\"\n  }\n```\n\nThis will then override the version of `react-native-permissions` in `react-native-qrcode-scanner` therefore resolve the issue.\n\n\nThanks for reading. Always keep learning!\n","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/override-version-for-package-dependency","date":"2023-08-22T19:43:00.000Z","title":"Override version for package dependency","excerpt":"Selective dependency resolutions","tags":["react-native"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2023/08/22-override-version-for-package-dependency/index.md","timeToRead":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
