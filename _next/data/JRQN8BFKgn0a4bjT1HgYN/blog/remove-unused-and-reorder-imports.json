{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\nToday, I revisited the react-native project that was developed and published by me earlier and the first thing I did was to run tests because I intended to add more Typescript support to the project, wanted to know the current state of test suites of the project.\n\nIt wasn't the best FIRST task as a start, but in my opinion, adding more Typescript will be benefiting over the long run.\n\nI've identified removing unused imports to be the low hanging fruit to fix the `tsc` errors.\n\nI started with [https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-unused-imports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-unused-imports) but turned out it also removes custom Types import that was used in my files.\n\nThen I found out that VS Code can achieve that with organize import feature.\n\n```\n\"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n\"[typescript]\": {\n    \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\": {\n        \"source.organizeImports\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThat works also with `Shift` + `Option` + `o` shortcut. However, that will also reorder the imports alphabetically.\nIt seems like there is no way to only remove unused imports without reorder them with `organizeImports`, that being one issue.\nThe second issue is that I need to also press the shortcut keys for every files. Which is very repetitive work, because there are 1105 files in my `/src` directory.\n\n```\n$ find src -type f | wc -l\n  1105\n```\n\nThe second issue was resolved with a VS Code extension to run `organizeImports` in a folder.\n\n[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.folder-source-actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.folder-source-actions)\n\nThen to reorder the imports to my desired orders, I found this great article [https://dev.to/otamnitram/sorting-your-imports-correctly-in-react-213m](https://dev.to/otamnitram/sorting-your-imports-correctly-in-react-213m) that does that.\n\nThis is my config\n\n```\n\"import/order\": [\n  \"error\",\n  {\n    \"groups\": [ \"builtin\", \"external\", \"internal\", [\"parent\", \"sibling\"] ],\n    \"pathGroups\": [\n      {\n        \"pattern\": \"react+(|-*)\",\n        \"group\": \"external\",\n        \"position\": \"before\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"pattern\": \"@**+(/**)\",\n        \"group\": \"internal\",\n        \"position\": \"before\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"pathGroupsExcludedImportTypes\": [\"react\"],\n    \"newlines-between\": \"always\",\n    \"alphabetize\": {\n      \"order\": \"asc\",\n      \"caseInsensitive\": true\n    }\n  }\n],\n```\n\nJust a TIL from me. That's it! Hope it helps.\n\nCheers.\n","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/remove-unused-and-reorder-imports","date":"2022-01-21T15:08:00.000Z","title":"Remove unused and reorder imports","excerpt":"With ESLint and VS Code","tags":["react-native","typescript"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2022/01/21-remove-unused-and-reorder-imports/index.md","timeToRead":2}},"__N_SSG":true}
