{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\n#### 1. Introduction\n\nThere are several use cases of resolving promise in Javascript.\n\n1. Resolve value once (commonly used)\n2. Multiple resolve at the same time, **order** of resolve **does not matter** (i.e. upload multiple images)\n3. Multiple resolve one at a time, **order** of resolve is **important** (i.e. call an API function or task sequentially after the previous call completed)\n\n#### 2. How it's done\n\n```\n  const sequentialFn = async () => {\n    for (const item of list) {\n      await task(item);\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nIt may seem to be the same as other iterable function method but there is a significant difference in behaviour and this will get the job done.\n\nThanks for reading, cheers!\n","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/sequential-promises","date":"2023-11-29T10:09:00.000Z","title":"Resolve array of promises in sequence","excerpt":"One at a time","tags":["react-native","javascript"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2023/11/29-sequential-promises/index.md","timeToRead":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
