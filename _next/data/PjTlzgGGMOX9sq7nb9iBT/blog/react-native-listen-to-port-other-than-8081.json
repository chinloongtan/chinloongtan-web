{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\nAfter trying out different solutions attempted to listen to different port other than 8081 for react-native metro bundler.\nFinally I have managed to achieve this **WITHOUT** the hassle of editing files such as:\n\n```\nRCTBridgeDelegate.h\nRTCDefines.h\nRCTInspectorDevServerHelper.m\nRCTDevMenu.m\n```\n\nWhile this approach works, the issue with it is the changes get reset after running `pod install`.\n\nSo after reading alot materials, with some improvisation, I came up with the solution using `Podfile`.\n\n<br />\n\n#### Podfile\n\n```\npost_install do |installer|\n  react_native_post_install(installer)\n  __apply_Xcode_12_5_M1_post_install_workaround(installer)\n\n  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|\n    if target.name == 'React-Core'\n      target.build_configurations.each do |config|\n        if config.name == 'Debug'\n          config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= ['$(inherited)']\n          config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] = config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] + ['RCT_METRO_PORT=8089']\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n<br />\n\n#### Metro server\n\n`npx react-native start --port=8089`\n\n<br />\n\nThat's it! Now, run `pod install` and run the app and it will be listening to port `8089`.\n\nFor Android, change the dev server setting from your device and it is reload the app. This part will not be covered in this article because there are alot of online resources that works perfectly.\n\nHope it helps.\n\nCheers.","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/react-native-listen-to-port-other-than-8081","date":"2022-01-17T15:33:00.000Z","title":"React Native Listen to Port Other Than 8081","excerpt":"A different approach using RCT_METRO_PORT","tags":["react-native"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2022/01/17-react-native-metro-port/index.md","timeToRead":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
