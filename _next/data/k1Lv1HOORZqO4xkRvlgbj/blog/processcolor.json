Check out the implementation of `processColor` over [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/StyleSheet/processColor.js).\n","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/processcolor","date":"2018-04-25T12:20:02.962Z","title":"processColor API","excerpt":"Color string meet native code","tags":["tool"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2018/04/25-processcolor/index.md","timeToRead":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
