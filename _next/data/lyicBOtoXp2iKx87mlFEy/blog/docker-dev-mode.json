{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":"\nDocker is helpful in a lot of ways.\n\nToday, after dockerizing an application's services into different containers,\nI ran into situation where I need to make changes to the code of one of the container that serves API.\n\nWell, docker dev mode is not really a thing/command that available out of the box.\nThough there are different ways to do it, I eventually did it with ``volumes``.\n\n\n    volumes:\n      - /Users/yourDir/yourAwesomeApp:/var/www/yourAwesomeApp\n\nIt is a concept of docker which let you ``mount`` a host to your container.\n\nAny changes you made to your host machine will be reflected in the container, without the need to stop and compose the services again.\n\nI will be sure to explore this topic deeper in the future.\n\nVisit my blog again in the future if you want to know more about my exploration with docker :)\n\n","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/docker-dev-mode","date":"2018-04-12T00:42:02.962Z","title":"Docker development mode","excerpt":"Making code changes in container","tags":["docker"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2018/04/12-docker-dev-mode.md","timeToRead":1}},"__N_SSG":true}
