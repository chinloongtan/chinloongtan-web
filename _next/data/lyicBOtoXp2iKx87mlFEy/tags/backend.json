I added `--enable-api` because my application mainly communicate via APIs.\n\n```\n  rasa run --enable-api\n```\n\n2. After making changes to the nlu.yml\n\n`rasa train`\n\n<br />\n\n#### Chat in action\n\nMy application can start replying to conversations by sending the message to my RASA bot server.\n\n`POST http://0.0.0.0:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook`\n\n```\n{\n  \"sender\": \"test_user\",\n  \"message\": \"Hi\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nSample response\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"recipient_id\": \"test_user\",\n        \"text\": \"Hey! How are you?\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThat's a good start, since I can now reply to a conversation from the response from RASA bot.\n\nWe want now move on to train the bot for more specific use case by determining the intent of the message.\n\nAnd we can do this by editing the file in `data/nlu.yml`.\n\nFor example, add\n\n`- salam sejahtera`\n\nto\n\n`- intent: greet`\n\nand run `rasa train` to update the model.\n\n\nWe can also define form depending on the business logic to handle more specific use case. Restaurant reservation/ordering for example.\n\n<br />\n\nThat's all for today!\n\nCheers.\n","fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2022/10/27-rasa-chat-bot/index.md","timeToRead":2}],"totalCount":1,"tag":"backend"},"__N_SSG":true}
