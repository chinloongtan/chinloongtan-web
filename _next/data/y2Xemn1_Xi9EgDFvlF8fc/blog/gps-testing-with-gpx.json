Basically it contains latitude, longitude and the timestamps at which the points are at.\n\nA simple `.gpx` file looks like this.\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<gpx version=\"1.1\" creator=\"gpxgenerator.com\">\n<wpt lat=\"3.109193\" lon=\"101.461774\">\n    <ele>7.00</ele>\n    <time>2018-01-04T08:08:05Z</time>\n</wpt>\n<wpt lat=\"3.109562\" lon=\"101.461968\">\n    <ele>7.00</ele>\n    <time>2018-01-04T08:08:20Z</time>\n</wpt>\n<wpt lat=\"3.109193\" lon=\"101.461774\">\n    <ele>6.96</ele>\n    <time>2018-01-04T08:08:35Z</time>\n</wpt>\n</gpx>\n```\n\nWhen you have that file, add it to your xcode, and you will be able to use the coordinates in your simulator with a toggle.\n\n![demo](gpx-xcode.png)\n\nSo for my case, I am having 3 different paths I created for development and testing purpose. Each of them in its own `.gpx` file.\n\nSelect any one, and the simulator will pick up the location and changes over time.\n\n<br />\n\n##### End\n\nNow you have different coordinates as time passes returned from the simulator to test.\n\n<br />\n\n","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/gps-testing-with-gpx","date":"2018-12-20T16:57:00.962Z","title":"GPS testing with .gpx file","excerpt":"For faster development","tags":["gps"]},"fullPath":"/Users/chinloong/makespace/chinloongtan-web/src/content/blog/2018/12/20-gps-testing-with-gpx/index.md","timeToRead":2}},"__N_SSG":true}
