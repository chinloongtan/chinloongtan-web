us)\n\nThe quality of application is satisfying at this point. Since we just launched, we never know the reputation from new users though, I think it was a good decision to develop with React Native because it's fast enough and easy to operate (upload new jobs or information) from single backend and reveal on both Android and iOS at the very same time with exactly same appearance.\n    ",avatar:s.shu},{id:"deanvern",name:"Goh Dean Vern",title:"Ecommerce Business Owner",text:"A high responsibility person and developer i have working with for almost 1.5 years was corporate with chin loong on an E-commerce apps startup.\nThe best part we found out interesting regarding Chin loong is he always able to think from different dimension especially from business perspective, this definitely giving client best return on either reducing the cost or those unnecessary developing and waste it.\n\nchin loong actively looking for solution and suggest different way in solving problem. this purely create a great value for our team which are not strong in IT knowledge, and it enable us a lot to focus on other business matter.\n\nchin loong usually able to interpret clearly and logically the instruction we given, he will analyse all the instruction and give the best advise for us whether it is workable or it is just unuseful.
