The data is ready to be used.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Now the app started working offline, and it is just the beginning of offline-first app journey.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"October 04, 2018",path:"/blog/offline-app-with-realm-db",title:"Going offline with Realm database",excerpt:"A different approach",tags:["realm-db","offline-first"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
